Sample Usage:
$ python dev_music.py  -i input_file.txt

Input File Format:
<note>, <duration>
<note>, <duration>
...

where <note> is a musical note in the range [A-G#] (flat notes, e.g. Bb, are
currently not supported), and duration is the length you wish to play that 
note.


Example Input File:
A, 0.2
B, 0.2
C, 0.1
B, 0.1
C, 0.1
A, 0.4
D, 0.4
A, 0.2
B, 0.2
C, 0.1
B, 0.1
C, 0.1
A, 0.4
D, 0.4


TODOs: 
* Allow specification of note delimiter in the input file (currently assumed as
  being the newline character).
* Allow specification of note/duration delimiter (currently assumed as being 
  comma).
* In fact, use a proper input file format (perhaps try to find something 
  standardised)
* Add --tempo option
* Add aliases for flat notes (e.g. Bb->A#)
* Set upper limit on duration?
* Implement REPL?
* Document how this works a bit better.
